  <h1>Catching Up With Omar Apollo, Indiana's Rising Rock Star
  <p><img src="img/OmarApollo.jpg" width="650" height="400"></p></h1>
  <p>When we first interviewed Omar Apollo almost exactly a year ago, "Brakelights" was in rotation, and the young Indiana singer was singing about his sucky car. A lot can change in a year—things have been going well, and it was time to catch up.</p>
  <p>The thoroughly impressive Stereo EP dropped at the end of May, and Apollo hit the road two weeks ago. When our call connected he was at a drive-thru somewhere between Dallas and Austin, grabbing coffee with the band before their show that night. The two-month sojourn is the artist's first as a headliner—it's called the "W.A.N.T." tour, short for "We are Niños Timidos." He laughs when asked about the name. "I guess it’s an act. I’m not fuckin’ shy—my drummer’s shy though. We have one shy guy."</p>
  <p>He'll head back to Indiana when tour wraps at the end of the month. Home is just south of Chicago, and the Midwest is well-represented in Apollo's "Ignorin" video. The artist rocks a Notre Dame shirt in the video, and the video is a high-energy look at Apollo's life, full of grass, trees, and bonfires. "Everyone’s always like, 'What do y’all do in Indiana?,'" he says. "But there's been a pattern—anywhere I go and I meet someone I really like, they’re always from the Midwest."</p>
  <p>It's an especially potent point in 2018, a time when the Midwest is often unfairly derided as "flyover country." But Omar Apollo is proving the close-minded wrong, one show at a time.</p>
