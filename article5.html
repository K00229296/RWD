  </h1>
  <p>2018 definitely felt like the year of Cardi B, and it looks like it's ending on a high note as TIME Magazine named her album Invasion of Privacy the year's best. After dropping in April, the rapper topped the Billboard 200 charts and ruled much of the summer with singles like "I Like It" and "Ring".</p>
  <p>“Invasion of Privacy delivered–not just on the dark, defensive rap that earned her legions of fans, but also with irresistible hits like the fizzy ‘I Like It,’ which nods at her Latin roots,” said the magazine. “Cardi’s debut doesn’t just earn her a seat at hip-hop’s table–it marks her as a singular voice.”</p>
  <p>TIME Magazine ranked all of the year's best albums, with a list that included Janelle Monae, Mitski and Camila Cabello.</p>
