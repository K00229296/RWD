  <p><img src="img/LilPeep.png" width="500" height="500" ></p></h1>
  <p>Billboard has announced the first week sales and chart placing of Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 2, the first posthumous album from Lil Peep. The album sold 81,000 equivalent units, with 43,000 pure album sales to debut at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Peep's debut album Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 1, released in August 2017 to no chart placing, bowed at No. 38 in the weeks following Peep's death of an overdose.</p>
  <p>More music from Lil Peep is in the works, as well as a documentary executive-produced by Terrence Malick. However, this weekend Peep's producer Smokeasac shot down rumours of an upcoming Come Over When You're Sober, Pt. 3 release. "COWYS part 3 doesn’t exist but there is still unreleased music from Peep," he wrote.</p>
